## Theme: "Prototyping a Box: Material + Metaphor"

Throughout the week, we will survey physical computing and digital fabrication techniques by modelling, fabricating, programming, and repurposing boxes as both bits and atoms, materials and metaphors. We will consider how boxes serve multiple, often contradictory, functions. They are containers. They house computers and electronics. They frequently render their contents invisible. They are sculptures. They are conversation pieces. They can even be art objects. During the course, you will have the opportunity to prototype your own box and explain how it operates as both a material and a metaphor.  

## Learning Expectations  

By the end of the week, you should: 

* Learn the basics of physical computing, 3D modelling, and fabrication. 
* Identify the common components of physical computing and fabrication projects. 
* In small groups (3-4 people), prototype a box and then communicate the aims of your prototype (as material and metaphor) to others in the course. 
* Know how to share the components of your prototype online. 

## Definitions 

Physical computing "means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world. While this definition is broad enough to encompass things such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In the broad sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware." More care of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing). 

Digital modelling and fabrication "is a process that joins design with the Construction / Production through the use of 3D modelling software and additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. These tools allow designers to produce material digitally, which is something greater than an image on screen, and actually tests the accuracy of the software and computer lines." More care of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_modeling_and_fabrication). 

## Software 

Before or during the course, it would be great if you could install the following software on your own machine: 

* [Arduino Integrated Design Environment](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/)
* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/)
* [Processing](http://www.processing.org)
* [CorelDRAW](http://www.coreldraw.com/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

In some cases (e.g., CorelDRAW and PhotoScan), you may want to consider trial licenses. Also, feel free to start an account with [GitHub](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one. 

## Hardware

To the course, you should bring your own laptop, if possible. We will bring the following for you to use: 

* Arduinos 
* Fabricated box components (in wood) 
* Sensors, actuators, wires, motors, batteries, and breadboards 
* Glue, scissors, calipers, and various crafting + design supplies 
* SLR cameras 

We (the instructors) also have access to CNC equipment for digital fabrication on the UVic campus. The four of us will be using this equipment to cut, mill, engrave, and design box components before and during DHSI. You do not need to provide your own box components.

## Schedule for the Week  

### Monday, June 8th (10:15-4:00)
* **10:15-10:30**, *Introductions*: We'll take a few minutes to say hello to each other. 
* **10:30-10:45**, *Theme for the Week (Jentery)*: We will briefly walk through the theme for the week, "Prototyping a Box: Material + Metaphor." Why use boxes as models for this course? What do they have to do with physical computing and fabrication? With the humanities? With critical and creative practice? 
* **10:45-12:00**, *Introduction to Arduino (Nina and Shaun)*: We will begin with an introduction to Arduino, the open-source microcontroller and Integrated Design Environment (IDE). During this time, we will walk through the components of the microcontroller, learn the basics of writing sketches in the IDE, briefly introduce the difference between digital and analog sensors and actuators, and begin building simple digital and analog circuits using switches, potentiometers, and LEDs.
