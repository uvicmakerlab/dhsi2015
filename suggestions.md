# Suggestions for Prototyping 

Below are some practical suggestions for prototyping projects involving physical computing and fabrication. 

## Before You Start Prototyping 

* Conduct an environmental scan. Is code already out there? Does a similar project already exist? Could you repurpose or edit existing models and builds? 
* Create a bill of materials that accounts for what the materials mean or connote. For instance, is plastic the best choice? 
* In terms of vendors, we often order from http://www.digikey.com/ and https://www.adafruit.com/. 
* Read reviews of any technologies before you purchase them. Ask others if they've used the technologies, too. Approach publications such as *Make* with some skepticism, or read against the grain of enthusiasm and hype. 

## As You Prototype 

* Consider working first with paper or modeling clay. This approach can save you both time and materials. 
* Circulate your prototype for feedback from friends. Have them interact with what you are making and document the interactions. * Wherever possible, write about the prototyping process. Reflect on it, too. 

## After You Prototype 

* Consider distributing your core files and documentation via a venue such as GitHub. 
* Take photos or video of the prototype for future reference. 
* Wherever possible, reuse parts for other projects, recycle them, or donate them to a group such as http://www.freegeek.org/. 
* Consider licensing your prototype.
